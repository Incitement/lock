# lock.py

A repository for messing around with encryption standards and other various locking mechanisms. Started as just various incomplete snippets of Python, and may or may not stay that way. Regardless I plan on applying what I learn with this repo to other security projects in the future, particularly for encrypting data. 

## Working Features
- Base64 encode
- ROT13 encode
- Caesar encode
- SHA256 encode
